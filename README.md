# Note Taker App

## Description

This is a simple note taker app that I made with express.js! This app was made to help myself and other users remember tasks by writing and saving notes with this app. While making this project, I learned how to use express.js to set up a server, make routes that bring in different html files, and set up api routes for fetch requests.

## Contributing

For this project, I looked back at the module 11 mini-project to use some of their utility functions. I also rewatched Trey make the mini project in order to help me make this app. I used the 'uuid' npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid Lastly, I also watched this youtube video to help with express.js https://youtu.be/L72fhGm1tfE?si=5VEkVHMWOv0tHj2E (Express.js crash course from traversy media)
